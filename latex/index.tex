This is a Physics Engine for 2d C++ applications and is a light weight tool designed for fairly simple C++ projects. ~\newline
 Download or view the code from github \href{https://github.com/CappLucas/CppPhysicsEngine}{\texttt{ here}}. ~\newline

The physics engine works as follows\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Class called {\itshape \doxylink{class_object_manager}{Object\+Manager}} manages objects in the simulation.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{stores, removes, adds, finds, and loops through}} objects to update them.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Class called {\itshape \doxylink{class_object}{Object}} represents any object or entity in your simulation.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Contains members like {\bfseries{Velocity}}, {\bfseries{Acceleration}}, {\bfseries{Mass}}, and more.
\item Contains members based on the given shape.
\item Updates it\textquotesingle{}s position given a delta time.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Class called {\itshape \doxylink{class_rectangle}{Rectangle}} represents a rectangular game object.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Contains member called plane.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Class called {\itshape \doxylink{class_circle}{Circle}} represents a circular game object.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Contains members like radius and center.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Class called {\itshape Collision manager} manages collisions
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Holds a {\itshape reference} to objects in an instance of and {\bfseries{\doxylink{class_object_manager}{Object\+Manager}}} class
\item Finds collisions, then resolves collisions my changing positions and other attributes of game objects.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item File called {\itshape \doxylink{_physics_equations_8h}{Physics\+Equations.\+h}} holds functions that represent physics equations.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Contains functions like {\bfseries{find\+Velocity(delta\+Time, Velocity, Acceleration)}}, or {\bfseries{find\+Force(\+Mass, Acceleration)}}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
